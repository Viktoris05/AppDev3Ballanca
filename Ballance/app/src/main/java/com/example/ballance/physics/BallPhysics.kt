/**
 *
 * A BallPhysics implementation is responsible for:
 *  1. Consuming the current ball position and device tilt input.
 *  2. Integrating acceleration and friction over a real elapsed time (deltaTime).
 *  3. Performing collision checks against the maze grid.
 *  4. Producing a new, updated ball position.
 *
 * By accepting a deltaTime parameter, implementations remain framerate independent
 * and produce consistent behavior whether running at 30fps or 120fps.
